		<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

		<p><b>Queen</b> are a British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music" target="_blank">rock</a> band formed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target="_blank">London</a> in 1970. Their classic line-up was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury" target="_blank">Freddie Mercury</a> (lead vocals and piano), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_May" target="_blank">Brian May</a> (lead guitar and vocals), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Taylor_(Queen_drummer)" target="_blank">Roger Taylor</a> (drums and vocals), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deacon" target="_blank">John Deacon</a> (bass guitar). Their earliest works were influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock" target="_blank">progressive rock</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock" target="_blank">hard rock</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" target="_blank">heavy metal</a>, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and <u>radio-friendly</u> works by incorporating further styles, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_rock" target="_blank">arena rock</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_rock" target="_blank">pop rock</a>.</p>
	
		<p><b>Before</b> forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(band)" target="_blank">Smile</a>. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more <u>elaborate stage</u> and <u>recording techniques</u>. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited before the band recorded their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(Queen_album)" target="_blank">eponymous debut album</a> in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_II" target="_blank"><i>Queen II</i></a>, in 1974. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheer_Heart_Attack" target="_blank"><i>Sheer Heart Attack</i></a> later that year and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Night_at_the_Opera_(Queen_album)" target="_blank"><i>A Night at the Opera</i></a> in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody" target="_blank">"Bohemian Rhapsody"</a>, which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video" target="_blank">music video</a>.</p>

		<p><b>The band’s</b> 1977 album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_of_the_World_(album)" target="_blank"><i>News of the World</i></a> contained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Will_Rock_You" target="_blank">"We Will Rock You"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_the_Champions" target="_blank">"We Are the Champions</a>, which have become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem" target="_blank">anthems</a> at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_rock" target="_blank">stadium rock</a> bands in the world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_One_Bites_the_Dust" target="_blank">"Another One Bites the Dust"</a> (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Hits_(Queen_album)" target="_blank">Greatest Hits</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_albums_in_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank">best-selling album in the UK</a> and is certified <i>eight times</i> platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid" target="_blank">Live Aid</a> concert has been ranked among the <u>greatest in rock history</u> by various publications. Mercury gave his last performance at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerts_at_Knebworth_House" target="_blank">Knebworth</a>, England, in August 1986, with Queen. In 1991, he died of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia" target="_blank">bronchopneumonia</a>, a complication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS" target="_blank">AIDS</a>, and Deacon retired in 1997. May and Taylor have performed under the Queen name with vocalists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rodgers" target="_blank">Paul Rodgers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Lambert" target="_blank">Adam Lambert</a> since.</p>

	<h1 id="History">History</h1>

		<h2 id="1968_-_1974_:_Early_era">1.1 1968-1974: Early era</h2>

			<p>In 1968, guitarist Brian May, a student at London's Imperial College, and bassist Tim Staffell decided to form a band. May placed an advertisement on a college notice board for a "Mitch Mitchell/Ginger Baker type" drummer; Roger Taylor, a young dental student, auditioned and got the job. The group called themselves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(band)" target="_blank">Smile</a>.[1] </p>

			<p>While attending Ealing Art College in west London, Tim Staffell became friends with Farrokh “Freddie” Bulsara, a fellow student from Zanzibar of Indian Parsi descent.[2] Bulsara, who was working as a baggage handler at London’s Heathrow Airport, felt that he and the band had the same tastes and soon became a keen fan of Smile. In 1970, after Staffell left to join the band Humpy Bong, the remaining Smile members, encouraged by now-member Bulsara, changed their name to "Queen" and performed their first gig on 18 July.[3] The band had a number of bass players during this period who did not fit with the band's chemistry. It was not until February 1971 that they settled on John Deacon and began to rehearse for their first album. They recorded four of their own songs, "Liar", "Keep Yourself Alive", "The Night Comes Down" and "Jesus", for a demo tape; no record companies were interested.[4] It was also around this time Freddie changed his surname to "Mercury", inspired by the line "Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me" in the song "My Fairy King".[5] On 2 July 1971, Queen played their first show in the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London.[6] </p>

			<p>Having attended art college, Mercury also designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album.[7] The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(astrology)" target="_blank">Leo</a> (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury).[7] The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion.[7] There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters.[7] The original logo, as found on the reverse-side of the cover of the band's first album, was a simple line drawing. Later sleeves bore more intricate-coloured versions of the logo.[7][8] </p>

			<p>In 1972, Queen entered discussions with Trident Studios after being spotted at De Lane Lea Studios by John Anthony. After these discussions, Norman Sheffield offered the band a management deal under Neptune Productions, a subsidiary of Trident, to manage the band and enable them to use the facilities at Trident to record new material, whilst the management searched for a record label to sign Queen. This suited both parties, as Trident were expanding into management, and under the deal, Queen were able to make use of the hi-tech recording facilities used by other musicians such as the Beatles and Elton John to produce new material.[9] Roger Taylor later described these early off-peak studio hours as "gold dust".[10]</p>

			<p>In 1973, Queen signed to a deal with Trident/EMI. By July of that year, they released their eponymous debut album, an effort influenced by heavy metal and progressive rock.[11] The album was received well by critics; Gordon Fletcher of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a> called it "superb",[12] and Chicago's Daily Herald called it an "above average debut".[13] However, it drew little mainstream attention, and the lead single "Keep Yourself Alive" sold poorly. Retrospectively, it is cited as the highlight of the album, and in 2008 Rolling Stone ranked it 31st in the "100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time", describing it as "an entire album's worth of riffs crammed into a single song".[14] The album was certified gold in the UK and the US.[15][16]</p>

			<p>The group's second LP, Queen II, was released in 1974, and features rock photographer Mick Rock's iconic image of the band on the cover.[17] This image would be used as the basis for the 1975 "Bohemian Rhapsody" music video production.[17][18] The album reached number five on the British album chart and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK.[15] The Freddie Mercury-written lead single "Seven Seas of Rhye" reached number ten in the UK, giving the band their first hit.[15] The album is the first real testament to the band's distinctive layered sound, and features long complex instrumental passages, fantasy-themed lyrics, and musical virtuosity.[19][20] Aside from its only single, the album also included the song "The March of the Black Queen", a six-minute epic which lacks a chorus. The Daily Vault described the number as "menacing".[21] Critical reaction was mixed; the Winnipeg Free Press, while praising the band's debut album, described Queen II as an "over-produced monstrosity".[22] AllMusic has described the album as a favourite among the band's hardcore fans,[23] and it is the first of three Queen albums to feature in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Albums_You_Must_Hear_Before_You_Die" target="_blank">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>.[24]</p>

		<h2 id="1974_-_1976_:_Sheer_Heart_Attack_to_A_Night_at_the_Opera">1.2 1974-1976: Sheer Heart Attack to A Night at the Opera</h2>

			<p>In May 1974, a month into the band's first US tour opening for Mott the Hoople, Brian May collapsed and was diagnosed with hepatitis, forcing the cancellation of their remaining dates.[19] While recuperating, May was initially absent when the band started work on their third album, but he returned midway through the recording process.[25] Released in 1974, Sheer Heart Attack reached number two in the United Kingdom,[26] sold well throughout Europe, and went gold in the United States.[16] It gave the band their first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic.[27] The album experimented with a variety of musical genres, including British music hall, heavy metal, ballads, ragtime, and Caribbean. At this point, Queen started to move away from the progressive tendencies of their first two releases into a more radio-friendly, song-orientated style.[28] Sheer Heart Attack introduced new sound and melody patterns that would be refined on their next album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Night_at_the_Opera_(Queen_album)" target="_blank">A Night at the Opera</a>.</p>

			<p>The single "Killer Queen" from Sheer Heart Attack reached number two on the British charts,[15] and became their first US hit, reaching number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.[29] It combines camp, vaudeville, and British music hall with May's guitar virtuosity. The album's second single, "Now I'm Here", a more traditional hard rock composition, was a number eleven hit in Britain, while the high speed rocker "Stone Cold Crazy" featuring May's uptempo riffs is a precursor to speed metal.[25][30] In recent years, the album has received acclaim from music publications: In 2006, Classic Rock ranked it number 28 in "The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever",[31] and in 2007, Mojo ranked it No.88 in "The 100 Records That Changed the World".[32] It is also the second of three Queen albums to feature in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[24]</p>

			<p>In January 1975, the band left for a world tour with each member in Zandra Rhodes-created costumes and accompanied with banks of lights and effects. They toured the US as headliners, and played in Canada for the first time,[33] after that they played in seven cities of Japan from mid-April to the start of May. In September, after an angry split with Trident, the band negotiated themselves out of their Trident Studios contract and searched for new management. One of the options they considered was an offer from Led Zeppelin's manager, Peter Grant. Grant wanted them to sign with Led Zeppelin's own production company, Swan Song Records. The band found the contract unacceptable and instead contacted Elton John's manager, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Reid_(music_manager)" target="_blank">John Reid</a>, who accepted the position.[34]</p>

			<p>In late 1975, Queen recorded and released A Night at the Opera, taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced.[35] Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. In "The Prophet's Song", an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, "Love of My Life", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies.[36] The album was very successful in Britain,[15] and went triple platinum in the United States.[16] The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll.[37] It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time,[38] while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time.[39] A Night at the Opera has frequently appeared in "greatest albums" lists reflecting the opinions of critics. Among other accolades, it was ranked number 16 in Q magazine’s "The 50 Best British Albums Ever" in 2004, and number 11 in Rolling Stone's "The 100 Greatest Albums of All Time" as featured in their Mexican edition in 2004.[40] It was also placed at number 230 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" in 2003.[41] A Night at the Opera is the third and final Queen album to be featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[24]</p>

			<p>The album also featured the hit single "Bohemian Rhapsody", which was number one in the UK for nine weeks.[15] Mercury's close friend and advisor, Capital London radio DJ Kenny Everett, played a pivotal role in giving the single exposure.[43][44] It is the third-best-selling single of all time in the UK, surpassed only by Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?" and Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 1997", and is the best-selling commercial single (i.e. not for-charity) in the UK. It also reached number nine in the United States (a 1992 re-release reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks).[29] It is the only single ever to sell a million copies on two separate occasions,[45] and became the Christmas number one twice in the UK, the only single ever to do so. "Bohemian Rhapsody" has also been voted the greatest song of all time in three different polls.[46][47][48] The band decided to make a video to help go with the single and hired Trilion,[49] a subsidiary of the former management company Trident Studios, using new technology to create the video; the result is generally considered to have been the first "true" music video ever produced,[50][51][52] and popularised the medium.[53] Although other bands, including the Beatles, had made short promotional films or videos of songs before, most of those were made to be aired on specific television shows. According to Brian May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on the BBC’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops" target="_blank">Top of the Pops</a>, since it would have looked strange miming to such a complex song.[42] In addition, the band knew they would be set to appear at Dundee's Caird Hall on tour and would be unable to appear on Top of the Pops.[54]</p> 

			<p>On the impact of "Bohemian Rhapsody", Rolling Stone states: "Its influence cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air."[51] Ranking it number 31 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history, The Guardian stated it ensured "videos would henceforth be a mandatory tool in the marketing of music".[53] The album's first track "Death on Two Legs" is said to have been written by Mercury about Norman Sheffield (and the former management at Trident who helped make the video so popular) because the band was broke despite the success of the previous album.[9][54] The second single from the album, "You're My Best Friend", the second song composed by John Deacon, and his first single, peaked at number sixteen in the United States[29] and went on to become a worldwide top-ten hit.[44] The band's A Night at the Opera Tour began in November 1975, and covered Europe, the United States, Japan, and Australia.[55]</p>

		<h2 id="1976_-_1979_:_A_Day_at_the_Races_to_Live_Killers">1.3 1976-1979: A Day at the Races to Live Killers</h2>

			<p>By 1976, Queen were back in the studio recording A Day at the Races, which is often regarded as a sequel album to A Night at the Opera.[56][57] It again borrowed the name of a Marx Brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of A Night at the Opera, a variation on the same Queen Crest.[58] The most recognisable of the Marx Brothers, Groucho Marx, invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home in March 1977; there the band thanked him in person, and performed "'39" a cappella.[59] Musically, A Day at the Races was by both fans' and critics' standards a strong effort, reaching number one in the UK and Japan, and number five in the US.[15][58] The major hit on the album was "Somebody to Love", a gospel-inspired song in which Mercury, May, and Taylor multi-tracked their voices to create a 100-voice gospel choir. The song went to number two in the UK,[15] and number thirteen in the US.[29] The album also featured one of the band's heaviest songs, May's "Tie Your Mother Down", which became a staple of their live shows.[60][61]</p>

			<p>During 1976, Queen played one of their most famous gigs, a free concert in Hyde Park, London.[62] A concert organised by the entrepreneur Richard Branson, it set an attendance record with 150,000 people confirmed in the audience.[62][63] On 1 December 1976, Queen were the intended guests on London's early evening Today programme, but they pulled out at the last-minute, which saw their late replacement on the show, EMI labelmate the Sex Pistols, give their infamous expletive-strewn interview with Bill Grundy.[64][65] During the A Day at the Races Tour in 1977, Queen performed sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden, New York, in February, and Earls Court, London, in June.[18][66]</p>

			<p>The band's sixth studio album News of the World was released in 1977, which has gone four times platinum in the United States, and twice in the UK.[16] The album contained many songs tailor-made for live performance, including two of rock's most recognisable anthems, "We Will Rock You" and the rock ballad "We Are the Champions", both of which became enduring international sports anthems, and the latter reached number four in the US.[29][67] Queen commenced the News of the World Tour in November 1977, and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called this concert tour the band's "most spectacularly staged and finely honed show".[68]</p>

			<p>In 1978, the band released Jazz, which reached number two in the UK and number six on the Billboard 200 in the US.[69] The album included the hit singles:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Bottomed_Girls" target="_blank">"Fat Bottomed Girls"</a></li>

					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Stop_Me_Now" target="_blank">"Don't Stop Me Now"</a></li>
				</ul>

			<p>In 1978, Queen toured the US and Canada, and spent much of 1979 touring in Europe and Japan.[72] They released their first live album, Live Killers, in 1979; it went platinum twice in the US.[73] Queen also released the very successful single "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of Elvis Presley.[74][75] The song made the top 10 in many countries, topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven consecutive weeks, and was the band's first number one single in the United States where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks.[29][76] Having written the song on guitar and played rhythm on the record, Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he ever played guitar in concert.[75] In December 1979, Queen played the opening night at the Concert for the People of Kampuchea in London, having accepted a request by the event's organiser Paul McCartney.[75]</p>

		<h2 id="1980_-_1984_:_The_Game_to_The_Works">1.4 1980-1984: The Game to The Works</h2>

			<p>Queen began their 1980s career with The Game. It featured the singles "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" and "Another One Bites the Dust", both of which reached number one in the US.[29] After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that "Another One Bites the Dust" be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one.[77] The album topped the Billboard 200 for five weeks,[78] and sold over four million copies in the US.[16] It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. Heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive "No Synthesisers!" sleeve note. The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-"hard"-rock stance by the band,[79] but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums' multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not synths, as record company executives kept assuming at the time.[80] In September 1980, Queen performed three sold-out shows at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden" target="_blank">Madison Square Garden</a>.[18] In 1980, Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for Flash Gordon.[81] At the 1981 American Music Awards in January, "Another One Bites the Dust" won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single, and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group.[82]</p>

			<p>In February 1981, Queen travelled to South America as part of The Game Tour, and became the first major rock band to play in Latin American stadiums.[72] The tour included five shows in Argentina, one of which drew the largest single concert crowd in Argentine history with an audience of 300,000 in Buenos Aires[83] and two concerts at the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, Brazil, where they played to an audience of more than 131,000 people in the first night (then the largest paying audience for a single band anywhere in the world)[84] and more than 120,000 people the following night.[85] In October of the same year, Queen performed for more than 150,000 fans on 9 October at Monterrey (Estadio Universitario) and 17 and 18 at Puebla (Estadio Zaragoza), Mexico.[86] On 24 and 25 November, Queen played two sell out nights at the Montreal Forum, Quebec, Canada.[87] One of Mercury's most notable performances of The Game's final track, "Save Me", took place in Montreal, and the concert is recorded in the live album, Queen Rock Montreal.[88]</p>

			<p>Queen worked with David Bowie on the single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Pressure" target="_blank">"Under Pressure</a>. The first-time collaboration with another artist was spontaneous, as Bowie happened to drop by the studio while Queen were recording.[90] Upon its release, the song was extremely successful, reaching number one in the UK and featuring at number 31 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s.[91]</p>

			<p>In October that year, Queen released their first compilation album, titled Greatest Hits, which showcased the group's highlights from 1974 to 1981.[92] It is the best-selling album in UK Chart history, and has spent 450 weeks in the UK Album Chart.[93] The album is certified eight times platinum in the United States, and has sold over 25 million copies worldwide.[16][94] Taylor became the first member of the band to release his own solo album in 1981, titled Fun in Space.</p>

			<p>In 1982, the band released the album Hot Space, a departure from their trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of rock, pop rock, dance, funk, and R&B.[95] Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the band's history, and Taylor and May lamented the new sound, with both being very critical of the influence Mercury's personal manager Paul Prenter had on the singer.[96] May was also scathing of Prenter, who was Mercury's manager from the early 1980s to 1984, for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations, such as the US networks, and their vital connection between the artist and the community, and for denying them access to Mercury.[97] Q magazine would list Hot Space as one of the top fifteen albums where great rock acts lost the plot.[98] On 14 and 15 September 1982, the band performed their last two gigs in the US with Mercury on lead vocals, playing at The Forum in Inglewood, California.[99] The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there had waned, although they would perform on American television for the only time during the eighth-season premiere of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" target="_blank"><i>Saturday Night Live</i></a> on 25 September of the same year;[100] it became the final public performance of the band in North America before the death of their frontman. Queen left Elektra Records, their label in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, and signed onto EMI/Capitol Records.</p>

			<p>After working steadily for over ten years, Queen decided that they would not perform any live shows in 1983.[101] During this time, they recorded a new album at the Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles and Musicland Studios, Munich, and several members of the band explored side projects and solo work. Taylor released his second solo album, Strange Frontier. May released the mini-album Star Fleet Project, collaborating with Eddie Van Halen.[102]</p>

			<p>In February 1984, Queen released their eleventh studio album, The Works, which included the successful singles: </p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Ga_Ga" target="_blank">"Radio Gaga"</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_to_Fall" target="_blank">"Hammer to Fall"</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Break_Free" target="_blank">"I Want to Break Free"</a></li>
				</ul>
			<p>Despite these hit singles, the album failed to do well in the US, where the cross-dressing video for "I Want to Break Free" – a parody of the British soap opera Coronation Street – proved controversial and was banned by MTV,[105] while in the UK it went triple platinum and remained in the albums chart for two years.[106] The concept of the video came from Roger Taylor, who stated to Q magazine: "We had done some really serious, epic videos in the past, and we just thought we'd have some fun. We wanted people to know that we didn't take ourselves too seriously, that we could still laugh at ourselves. I think we proved that."[107]</p>

			<p>That year, Queen began The Works Tour, the first tour to feature keyboardist Spike Edney as an extra live musician. The tour featured nine sold-out dates in October in Bophuthatswana, South Africa, at the arena in Sun City.[108][109] Upon returning to England, they were the subject of outrage, having played in South Africa during the height of apartheid and in violation of worldwide divestment efforts and a United Nations cultural boycott. The band responded to the critics by stating that they were playing music for fans in South Africa, and they also stressed that the concerts were played before integrated audiences.[110] Queen donated to a school for the deaf and blind as a philanthropic gesture but were fined by the British Musicians' Union and placed on the United Nations' blacklisted artists.[111]</p>

		<h2 id="1985_-_1988_:_Live_Aid_and_tours">1.5 1985-1988: Live Aid and tours</h2>

			<p>In January 1985, Queen headlined two nights of the first Rock in Rio festival at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and played in front of over 300,000 people each night.[112] The Boston Globe described it as a "mesmerising performance".[113] Highlights from both nights were released on VHS as Queen: Live in Rio, and was broadcast on MTV in the US.[113][114] In April and May 1985, Queen completed the Works Tour with sold-out shows in Australia and Japan.[115]</p>

			<p>At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid" target="_blank">Live Aid</a>, held at Wembley on 13 July 1985, in front of the biggest-ever TV audience of 1.9 billion, Queen performed some of their greatest hits. The sold-out stadium audience of 72,000 people clapped, sang, and swayed in unison.[117][118] The show's organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, other musicians such as Elton John, Cliff Richard and Dave Grohl, and journalists writing for the BBC, CNN, Rolling Stone, MTV, The Telegraph among others, described Queen as the highlight.[119][120][121][122] An industry poll in 2005 ranked it the greatest rock performance of all time.[119][123] Mercury's powerful, sustained note during the a cappella section came to be known as "The Note Heard Round the World".[124][125] The band were revitalised by the response to Live Aid – a “shot in the arm” Roger Taylor called it – and the ensuing increase in record sales.[126]</p>

			<p>Queen ended 1985 by releasing the single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Vision" target="_blank">"One Vision"</a> [127] and a limited-edition boxed set of Queen albums, The Complete Works. The package included the 1984 Christmas single "Thank God It's Christmas" and previously unreleased material.[128] In early 1986, Queen recorded the album A Kind of Magic, containing several reworkings of songs written for the fantasy action film Highlander.[129] The album was successful in the UK and many other countries, producing a string of hits including "A Kind of Magic", "One Vision", "Friends Will Be Friends", "Princes of the Universe" and "Who Wants to Live Forever". In the US the album only peaked at number 46, and it was described by biographer Mark Blake as "a so-so album" and "a somewhat uneven listening experience".[130]</p>

			<p>In mid-1986, Queen went on the Magic Tour, their final tour with Freddie Mercury,[132][133] joined again Edney.[134][135] The Magic Tour's highlight was at Wembley Stadium in London and resulted in the live double album Queen at Wembley, released on CD and as a live concert VHS/DVD, which has gone five times platinum in the US and four times platinum in the UK.[16][136] Queen could not book Wembley for a third night, but played at Knebworth Park. The show sold out within two hours and over 120,000 fans packed the park for what was Queen's final performance with Mercury.[137][138] Queen began the tour at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm, Sweden, and during the tour the band performed a concert at Slane Castle, Ireland, in front of an audience of 95,000, which broke the venue's attendance record.[139] The band also played behind the Iron Curtain when they performed to a crowd of 80,000 at the Népstadion in Budapest, in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe.[140] More than one million people saw Queen on the tour—400,000 in the UK alone, a record at the time.[109]</p>

			<p>After working on various solo projects during 1988 (including Mercury's collaboration with Montserrat Caballé, Barcelona), the band released The Miracle in 1989. The album continued the direction of A Kind of Magic, using a pop-rock sound mixed with a few heavy numbers. It spawned the European hits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_It_All_(Queen_song)" target="_blank">"I Want It All"</a>, "Breakthru", "The Invisible Man", "Scandal", and "The Miracle".[141] The Miracle also began a change in direction of Queen's songwriting philosophy. Beforehand, nearly all songs had been written by and credited to a single member. With The Miracle, their songwriting became more collaborative, and they vowed to credit the final product only to Queen as a group.[142]</p>

		<h2 id="1988_-_1992_:_Mercury_'_s_final_years">1.6 1988-1992: Mercury's final years</h2>

			<p>After fans noticed Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, the media reported that Mercury was seriously ill, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS" target="_blank">AIDS</a> frequently mentioned as a likely illness. Mercury denied this, insisting he was merely "exhausted" and too busy to provide interviews; he was now 42 years old and had been involved in music for nearly two decades.[144] Mercury had in fact been diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987, but did not make his illness public, with only his inner circle of colleagues and friends aware of his condition.[143]</p>

			<p>The band continued recording albums, starting with The Miracle (1989) and continuing with Innuendo (1991). In 1990, Queen ended their contract with Capitol and signed with Hollywood Records; through the deal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Music_Group" target="_blank">Disney</a> acquired the North American distribution rights to Queen's catalogue for $10 million, and remains the group's music catalogue owner and distributor in the United States and Canada.[145][146] In February that year, Mercury made his final public appearance when he joined the rest of Queen to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. Throughout 1990, media reports persisted that Mercury was seriously ill, but he continued to deny them.[147][148]</p>

			<p>Innuendo was released in early 1991 with an eponymous number 1 UK hit and other charting singles released later in the year, which included "The Show Must Go On". This song, released as a forerunner to Greatest Hits II, featured archive footage of Queen's performances between 1981 and 1989, and along with the manner of its lyrics, fuelled reports that Mercury was dying.[149][150] Mercury was increasingly ill and could barely walk when the band recorded "The Show Must Go On" in 1990. Because of this, May had concerns about whether he was physically capable of singing it, but May recalled that he "completely killed it".[151] The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, for an hour or two at a time. May says of Mercury: "He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really."[131] The band's second greatest hits compilation, Greatest Hits II, followed in October 1991; it is the tenth-bestselling album in the UK and has sold 16 million copies worldwide.[152][153][154]</p>

			<p>On 23 November 1991, in a prepared statement made on his deathbed, Mercury confirmed that he had AIDS.[155] Within 24 hours of the statement, he died of bronchial pneumonia, which was brought on as a complication of AIDS.[156] His funeral service on 27 November in Kensal Green, West London was private, and held in accordance with the Zoroastrian religious faith of his family.[157][158] "Bohemian Rhapsody" was re-released as a single shortly after Mercury's death, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Are_the_Days_of_Our_Lives" target="_blank">"There Are the Days of Our Lives"</a> as the double A-side. The music video for "These Are the Days of Our Lives" contains Mercury's final scenes in front of the camera. This track had featured at the beginning of the year on the Innuendo album, and the video for it was recorded in May 1991 (which proved to be Mercury's final work with Queen).[159] The single went to number one in the UK, remaining there for five weeks – the only recording to top the Christmas chart twice and the only one to be number one in four different years (1975, 1976, 1991, and 1992).[160] Initial proceeds from the single – approximately £1,000,000 – were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust, an AIDS charity.[161]</p>

			<p>Queen's popularity was stimulated in North America when "Bohemian Rhapsody" was featured in the 1992 comedy film Wayne's World.[162] Its inclusion helped the song reach number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks in 1992 (including its 1976 chart run, it remained in the Hot 100 for a combined 41 weeks),[162] and won the band an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award" target="_blank">MTV Award</a> at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.[163] The compilation album Classic Queen also reached number four on the Billboard 200, and is certified three times platinum in the US.[16][162] Wayne's World footage was used to make a new music video for "Bohemian Rhapsody", with which the band and management were delighted.[164]</p>

			<p>On 20 April 1992, The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert was held at London's Wembley Stadium to a 72,000-strong crowd.[165] Performers, including Def Leppard, Robert Plant, Tony Iommi, Roger Daltrey, Guns N' Roses, Elton John, David Bowie, George Michael, Annie Lennox, Seal, Extreme, and Metallica performed various Queen songs along with the three remaining Queen members (and Spike Edney.) The concert is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as "The largest rock star benefit concert",[166] as it was televised to over 1.2 billion viewers worldwide,[109] and raised over £20,000,000 for AIDS charities.[161]</p>

			<p>Queen's last album with Mercury, titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_Heaven" target="_blank"><i>Made in Heaven</i></a> Made in Heaven, was released in 1995, four years after his death.[167] Featuring tracks such as "Too Much Love Will Kill You" and "Heaven for Everyone", it was constructed from Mercury's final recordings in 1991, material left over from their previous studio albums and re-worked material from May, Taylor, and Mercury's solo albums. The album also featured the song "Mother Love", the last vocal recording Mercury made, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track.[168] After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he "wasn't feeling that great" and stated, "I will finish it when I come back, next time". Mercury never returned to the studio afterwards, leaving May to record the final verse of the song.[131] Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio in Montreux, Switzerland.[169] The album reached number one in the UK following its release, their ninth number one album, and sold 20 million copies worldwide.[170][171] On 25 November 1996, a statue of Mercury was unveiled in Montreux overlooking Lake Geneva, almost five years to the day since his death.[169][172]</p>

			<p>In 1997, Queen returned to the studio to record <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-One_but_You_(Only_the_Good_Die_Young)" target="_blank">"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)"</a>, a song dedicated to Mercury and all those who die too soon.[174] It was released as a bonus track on the Queen Rocks compilation album later that year.[175] In January 1997, Queen performed "The Show Must Go On" live with Elton John and the Béjart Ballet in Paris on a night Mercury was remembered, and it marked the last performance and public appearance of John Deacon, who chose to retire.[176] The Paris concert was only the second time Queen had played live since Mercury's death, prompting Elton John to urge them to perform again.[173] Brian May and Roger Taylor performed together at several award ceremonies and charity concerts, sharing vocals with various guest singers. During this time, they were billed as Queen + followed by the guest singer's name. In 1998, the duo appeared at Luciano Pavarotti's benefit concert with May performing "Too Much Love Will Kill You" with Pavarotti, later playing "Radio Ga Ga", "We Will Rock You", and "We Are the Champions" with Zucchero. They again attended and performed at Pavarotti's benefit concert in Modena, Italy in May 2003.[177] Several of the guest singers recorded new versions of Queen's hits under the Queen + name, such as Robbie Williams providing vocals for "We Are the Champions" for the soundtrack of A Knight's Tale (2001).[178]</p>

			<p>In 1999, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Hits_III_(Queen_album)" target="_blank"><i>Greatest Hits III</i></a> album was released. This featured, among others, "Queen + Wyclef Jean" on a rap version of "Another One Bites the Dust". A live version of "Somebody to Love" by George Michael and a live version of "The Show Must Go On" with Elton John were also featured in the album.[179] By this point, Queen's vast amount of record sales made them the second-bestselling artist in the UK of all time, behind the Beatles.[171] On 18 October 2002, Queen were awarded the 2,207th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for their work in the music industry, which is located at 6358 Hollywood Blvd.[180] On 29 November 2003, May and Taylor performed at the 46664 Concert hosted by Nelson Mandela at Green Point Stadium, Cape Town, to raise awareness of the spread of HIV/AIDS in South Africa.[181] A new song, "Invincible Hope", featuring Mandela's speech and credited to Queen + Nelson Mandela, was performed during the concert and later released on the 46664: One Year On EP.[182] During that period May and Taylor spent time at Mandela's home, discussing how Africa's problems might be approached, and two years later the band were made ambassadors for the 46664 cause.[181]</p>

		<h2 id="2004_-_2009_:_Queen_+_Paul_Rodgers">1.8 2004-2009: Queen + Paul Rodgers</h2>

			<p>At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be "featured with" Queen as "Queen + Paul Rodgers", not replacing Mercury. Deacon, who was retired, did not participate.[183] In November 2004, Queen were among the inaugural inductees into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Music_Hall_of_Fame" target="_blank">UK Music Hall of Fame</a>, and the award ceremony was the first event at which Rodgers joined May and Taylor as vocalist.[181][184]</p>

			<p>Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986.[185] Taylor said: "We never thought we would tour again, Paul came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie."[185] The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006.[186] Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006.[187] Foo Fighters paid homage, performing "Tie Your Mother Down" to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by May, Taylor, and Rodgers, who played a selection of Queen hits.[188]</p>

			<p>On 15 August 2006, May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a "secret location".[189] Queen + Paul Rodgers performed at the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute held in Hyde Park, London on 27 June 2008, to commemorate Mandela's ninetieth birthday, and again promote awareness of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.[190] The first Queen + Paul Rodgers album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008.[170] Following the release of the album, the band again went on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans.[191] The Kharkiv concert was later released on DVD.[191] The tour then moved to Russia, and the band performed two sold-out shows at the Moscow Arena.[192] Having completed the first leg of its extensive European tour, which saw the band play 15 sold-out dates across nine countries, the UK leg of the tour sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale and included three London dates, the first of which was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_O2_Arena" target="_blank">the O2 Arena</a> on 13 October.[193] The last leg of the tour took place in South America, and included a sold-out concert at the Estadio José Amalfitani, Buenos Aires.[192]</p>

			<p>Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009.[194] Rodgers stated: "My arrangement with [Queen] was similar to my arrangement with Jimmy [Page] in The Firm in that it was never meant to be a permanent arrangement".[194] Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working with Queen again.[195][196]</p>

			<p>On 20 May 2009, May and Taylor performed "We Are the Champions" live on the season finale of American Idol with winner Kris Allen and runner-up Adam Lambert providing a vocal duet.[197] In mid-2009, after the split of Queen + Paul Rodgers, the Queen online website announced a new greatest hits compilation named Absolute Greatest. The album was released on 16 November and peaked at number 3 in the official UK Chart.[198] The album contains 20 of Queen's biggest hits spanning their entire career and was released in four different formats: single disc, double disc (with commentary), double disc with feature book, and a vinyl record. Before its release, Queen ran an online competition to guess the track listing as a promotion for the album.[199] On 30 October 2009, May wrote a fanclub letter on his website stating that Queen had no intentions to tour in 2010 but that there was a possibility of a performance.[200] On 15 November 2009, May and Taylor performed "Bohemian Rhapsody" live on the British TV show The X Factor alongside the finalists.[201]</p>

			<p>On 7 May 2010, May and Taylor announced that they were quitting their record label, EMI, after almost 40 years.[203] On 20 August 2010, Queen's manager <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Beach" target="_blank">Jim Beach</a> put out a Newsletter stating that the band had signed a new contract with Universal Music.[202] During an interview for HARDtalk on the BBC on 22 September, May confirmed that the band's new deal was with Island Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group.[204][205] Hollywood Records remained as the group's label in the United States and Canada, however. As such, for the first time since the late 1980s, Queen's catalogue now has the same distributor worldwide, as Universal distributes for both the Island and Hollywood labels (for a time in the late 1980s, Queen was on EMI-owned Capitol Records in the US).[206]</p>

			<p>On 14 March 2011, which marked the band's 40th anniversary, Queen's first five albums were re-released in the UK and some other territories as remastered deluxe editions (the US versions were released on 17 May).[207] The second five albums of Queen's back catalogue were released worldwide on 27 June, with the exception of the US and Canada (27 September).[208][209] The final five were released in the UK on 5 September.[210]</p>

			<p>In May 2011, Jane's Addiction vocalist Perry Farrell noted that Queen are currently scouting their once former and current live bassist Chris Chaney to join the band. Farrell stated: "I have to keep Chris away from Queen, who want him and they're not gonna get him unless we're not doing anything. Then they can have him."[211] In the same month, Paul Rodgers stated he may tour with Queen again in the near future.[212] At the 2011 Broadcast Music, Incorporated (BMI) Awards held in London on 4 October, Queen received the BMI Icon Award in recognition for their airplay success in the US.[213][214] At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards on 6 November, Queen received the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Europe_Music_Award_for_Global_Icon" target="_blank">Global Icon Award</a>, which Katy Perry presented to Brian May.[215] Queen closed the awards ceremony, with Adam Lambert on vocals, performing "The Show Must Go On", "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions".[215] The collaboration garnered a positive response from both fans and critics, resulting in speculation about future projects together.[216]</p>

		<p>Queen drew artistic influence from British rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s, such as the Beatles, the Kinks, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Who, Black Sabbath, Slade, Deep Purple, David Bowie, Genesis and Yes,[245] in addition to American guitarist Jimi Hendrix,[246] with Mercury also inspired by the gospel singer Aretha Franklin.[247] May referred to the Beatles as being "our bible in the way they used the studio and they painted pictures and this wonderful instinctive use of harmonies."[248] At their outset in the early 1970s, Queen's music has been characterised as "Led Zeppelin meets Yes" due to its combination of "acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics".[249] In his book, Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, Eddie Trunk described Queen as "a hard rock band at the core but one with a high level of majesty and theatricality that delivered a little something for everyone", as well as observing that the band "sounded British".[250]</p>

		<p>In 2002, Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" was voted "the UK's favourite hit of all time" in a poll conducted by the Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book.[277] In 2004, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[278] Many scholars consider the "Bohemian Rhapsody" music video ground-breaking, crediting it with popularising the medium.[51][52] Rock historian Paul Fowles stated that the song is "widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy".[279] It has been hailed as launching the MTV age.[280] In December 2018, "Bohemian Rhapsody" became the most-streamed song from the 20th century, and the most-streamed classic rock song of all time.[281] The number of downloads of the song and original video exceeded 1.6 billion across global on-demand streaming services.[282] Acclaimed for their stadium rock, in 2005 an industry poll ranked Queen's performance at Live Aid in 1985 as the best live act in history.[264][283] In 2007, they were also voted the greatest British band in history by BBC Radio 2 listeners.[284]</p>

		<p>Queen have been credited with making a significant contribution to genres such as hard rock and heavy metal.[250][310] The band have been cited as an influence by many other musicians. Moreover, like their music, the bands and artists that have claimed to be influenced by Queen or have expressed admiration for them are diverse, spanning different generations, countries, and genres, including heavy metal: Judas Priest,[311] Iron Maiden,[312] Metallica,[313] Dream Theater,[314] Trivium,[315] Megadeth,[316] Anthrax,[317] Faith No More,[318] Melvins,[319] Slipknot[320] and Rage Against the Machine;[321] hard rock: Guns N' Roses,[322] Def Leppard,[323] Van Halen,[324] Mötley Crüe,[325] Steve Vai,[326] the Cult,[327] the Darkness,[328] Kid Rock[329] and Foo Fighters;[330] alternative rock: Nirvana,[331] Radiohead,[332] Trent Reznor,[333] Muse,[334] Red Hot Chili Peppers,[335] Jane's Addiction,[336] the Flaming Lips,[337] and The Smashing Pumpkins;[338] shock rock: Marilyn Manson;[339] pop rock: Meat Loaf,[340] The Killers,[341] My Chemical Romance,[342] Fall Out Boy[343] and Panic! at the Disco;[344] and pop: Michael Jackson,[345] George Michael,[346] Robbie Williams,[347] Adele,[348] Lady Gaga,[349] Katy Perry,[350] Kesha,[351] Grimes,[352] and Psy.[353]</p>

		<h2 id="Musical_theatre">Musical theatre</h2>

			<p>In May 2002, a musical or "rock theatrical" based on the songs of Queen, titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Will_Rock_You_(musical)" target="_blank"><i>We Will Rock You,</i></a> opened at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Theatre" target="_blank">Dominion Theatre</a> on London's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre" target="_blank">West End</a> [264]. The musical was written by British comedian and author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Elton" target="_blank">Ben Elton</a> in collaboration with Brian May and Roger Taylor, and produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" target="_blank">Robert De Niro.</a> It has since been staged in many cities around the world.[264] The launch of the musical coincided with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth II's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_jubilee" target="_blank">Golden Jubilee.</a> As part of the Jubilee celebrations, Brian May performed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_solo" target="_blank">guitar solo</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen" target="_blank">"God Save the Queen"</a>,[359] as featured on Queen's A Night at the Opera, from the roof of Buckingham Palace. The recording of this performance was used as video for the song on the 30th Anniversary DVD edition of A Night at the Opera.[360][361] Following the Las Vegas premiere on 8 September 2004, Queen were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk in Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.[362]</p>

			<p>The original London production was scheduled to close on Saturday, 7 October 2006, at the Dominion Theatre, but due to public demand, the show ran until May 2014.[363] We Will Rock You has become the longest running musical ever to run at this prime London theatre, overtaking the previous record holder, the musical Grease.[364] Brian May stated in 2008 that they were considering writing a sequel to We Will Rock You.[365] The musical toured around the UK in 2009, playing at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_Theatre,_Manchester" target="_blank">Manchester Palace Theatre</a>, Sunderland Empire, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Hippodrome" target="_blank">Birmingham Hippodrome</a>, Bristol Hippodrome, and Edinburgh Playhouse.[366]</p>

			<p>Sean Bovim created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_at_the_Ballet" target="_blank">"Queen at the Ballet</a>, a tribute to Mercury, which uses Queen's music as a soundtrack for the show's dancers, who interpret the stories behind tracks such as "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Radio Ga Ga", and "Killer Queen".[367] Queen's music also appears in the Off-Broadway production Power Balladz, most notably the song "We Are the Champions", with the show's two performers believing the song was "the apex of artistic achievement in its day".[368]</p>

		<h2 id="Digital_realm">Digital realm</h2>

			<p>In conjunction with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts" target="_blank">Electronic Arts</a>, Queen released the computer game Queen: The eYe in 1998.[369] The music itself—tracks from Queen's vast catalogue, in many cases remixed into new instrumental versions—was by and large well received, but the game experience was hampered by poor gameplay. Adding to the problem was an extremely long development time, resulting in graphic elements that already seemed outdated by the time of release.[370]</p>

			<p>Under the supervision of May and Taylor, numerous restoration projects have been under way involving Queen's lengthy audio and video catalogue. DVD releases of their 1986 Wembley concert (titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_at_Wembley" target="_blank"><i>Live at Wembley Stadium</i></a>), 1982 Milton Keynes concert (Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl), and two Greatest Video Hits (Volumes 1 and 2, spanning the 1970s and 1980s) have seen the band's music remixed into 5.1 and DTS surround sound. So far, only two of the band's albums, A Night at the Opera and The Game, have been fully remixed into high-resolution multichannel surround on DVD-Audio. A Night at the Opera was re-released with some revised 5.1 mixes and accompanying videos in 2005 for the 30th anniversary of the album's original release (CD+DVD-Video set). In 2007, a Blu-ray edition of Queen's previously released concerts, Queen Rock Montreal & Live Aid, was released, marking their first project in 1080p HD.[371]</p>

			<p>Queen have been featured multiple times in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero" target="_blank"><i>Guitar Hero</i></a> franchise. Here's all the songs that got put in various Guitar Hero games:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>"Killer Queen"</li>
					<li>"We Are The Champions"</li>
					<li>"Fat Bottomed Girls"</li>
					<li>"Under Pressure"</li>
					<li>"I Want It All"</li>
					<li>"Stone Cold Crazy"</li>
					<li>"Bohemian Rhapsody"</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Queen have also been featured multiple times in the Rock Band franchise: a track pack of 10 songs which are compatible with Rock Band, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Band_2" target="_blank"><i>Rock Band 2</i></a>, and Rock Band 3 (three of those are also compatible with Lego Rock Band). Their hit "Bohemian Rhapsody" was featured in Rock Band 3 with full harmony and keys support. The band also appeared in the video game Lego Rock Band as playable Lego avatars.[377]</p>

			<p>In March 2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment" target="_blank">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> released a Queen branded version of the company's karaoke franchise, SingStar. The game, which is available on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, is titled SingStar Queen and has 25 songs on the PS3 and 20 on the PS2.[378] "We Will Rock You" and other songs by Queen also appear in DJ Hero.[379]</p>

			<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Vision" target="_blank">"One Vision"</a> was featured on the successful video game Grand Theft Auto IV on the fictional radio station Liberty Rock Radio 97.8,[380] while "Radio Ga Ga" features on Grand Theft Auto V character trailer for Michael and the game's soundtrack.[381]</p>

		<h2 id="Film_and_television">Film and television</h2>

			<p>The soundtrack for the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Gordon_(film)" target="_blank"><i>Flash Gordon</i></a> (1980) was by Queen. The band also contributed music to Highlander (the original 1986 film),[129][382] with "A Kind of Magic", "One Year of Love", "Who Wants to Live Forever", "Hammer to Fall", and the theme "Princes of the Universe", which was also used as the theme of the Highlander TV series (1992–1998).[383] In the United States, "Bohemian Rhapsody" was re-released as a single in 1992 after appearing in the comedy film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne%27s_World_(film)" target="_blank"><i>Wayne's World</i></a>.[162] The single subsequently reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 (with "The Show Must Go On" as the first track on the single) and helped rekindle the band's popularity in North America.[162][384]</p>

			<p>Several films have featured their songs performed by other artists. A version of "Somebody to Love" by Anne Hathaway was in the 2004 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Enchanted_(film)" target="_blank"><i>Ella Enchanted</i></a> Ella Enchanted.[385] In 2006, Brittany Murphy also recorded a cover of the same song for the 2006 film Happy Feet.[386] In 2001, a version of "The Show Must Go On" was performed by Jim Broadbent and Nicole Kidman in the film musical Moulin Rouge!.[387] The 2001 film A Knight's Tale has a version of "We Are the Champions" performed by Robbie Williams and Queen; the film also features "We Will Rock You" played by the medieval audience.[388]</p>

			<p>"I Was Born to Love You" was used as the theme song of the Japanese television drama Pride on Fuji Television in 2004, starring Takuya Kimura and Yūko Takeuchi. The show's soundtrack also contained other songs by Queen.[389] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Stop_Me_Now" target="_blank">"Don't Stop Me Now"</a> has featured in the BBC television show Top Gear, and in 2005 the song was voted as "The Greatest Driving Song Ever" by the series' viewers.[390]</p>

			<p>Keeping in a tradition of naming each season's episodes after songs by 1970s rock bands, the eighth and final season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_%2770s_Show" target="_blank"><i>That '70s Show</i></a> had episodes named after Queen songs. "Bohemian Rhapsody" served as the season premiere.[391] The Simpsons has made storylines which have featured Queen songs such as "We Will Rock You", "We Are the Champions" (both sung by Homer), and "You're My Best Friend".[392]</p>

			<p>On 11 April 2006, Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared on the American singing contest television show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol" target="_blank"><i>
			American Idol</i></a>. Each contestant was required to sing a Queen song during that week of the competition. Songs which appeared on the show included "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Fat Bottomed Girls", "The Show Must Go On", "Who Wants to Live Forever", and "Innuendo". Brian May later criticised the show for editing specific scenes,[393] one of which made the group's time with contestant Ace Young look negative, despite it being the opposite. Taylor and May again appeared on the American Idol season 8 finale in May 2009, performing "We Are the Champions" with finalists Adam Lambert and Kris Allen.[197] On 15 November 2009, Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared on the singing contest television show The X Factor in the UK.[394]</p>

			<p>In the autumn of 2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)" target="_blank"><i>Glee</i></a> featured the fictional high school's show choir singing "Somebody to Love" as their second act performance in the episode "The Rhodes Not Taken". The performance was included on the show's Volume 1 soundtrack CD.[395] In June 2010, the choir performed "Another One Bites the Dust" in the episode "Funk".[396] The following week's episode, "Journey to Regionals", features a rival choir performing "Bohemian Rhapsody" in its entirety. The song was featured on the episode's EP. In May 2012, the choir performed "We Are the Champions" in the episode "Nationals", and the song features in The Graduation Album.[397]</p>

			<p>In a September 2010 BBC interview, Brian May announced in that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacha_Baron_Cohen" target="_blank">Sacha Baron Cohen</a> was to play Mercury in a biographical film about the band.[398] Time commented with approval on his singing ability and visual similarity to Mercury.[399]However, in July 2013, Baron Cohen dropped out of the role due to "creative differences" between him and the surviving band members.[400] In December 2013, it was announced that Ben Whishaw, known for playing Q in the James Bond film Skyfall, was a possible replacement for Baron Cohen in the role of Mercury,[401] but Whishaw pulled out a few months later amidst uncertainty about how the film was progressing.[402]</p>

			<p class="p1">The project regained momentum in 2016. It was announced on 4 November that the film had secured the backing of 20th Century Fox, New Regency and GK Films. By this time, the film's working title was Bohemian Rhapsody, after the band's song of the same name. Freddie Mercury was to be played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rami_Malek" target="_blank">Rami Malek</a>, and shooting was scheduled to begin in early 2017.[403] The motion picture was written by Anthony McCarten, with a story by McCarten and Peter Morgan, who received Oscar nominations for his screenplays The Queen and Frost/Nixon.[404]</p>

			<p class="p1">Released in October 2018, Bohemian Rhapsody focuses on Queen's formative years and the period leading up to the celebrated performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert.[408] The film has grossed over $870 million worldwide,[409] making it the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time.[410] Despite receiving mixed reviews, it won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Motion_Picture_–_Drama" target="_blank">Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama.</a> Malek received wide acclaim and numerous accolades for his portrayal of Mercury, including the Academy Award for Best Actor.[411] While the Live Aid segment was praised, criticism came from not exploring more complex themes involving Mercury, with the New York Post's Johnny Oleksinski stating, "What we ultimately wanted from Bohemian Rhapsody was not carbon-copied concerts, but behind-closed-doors insight into a deeply private, complicated, internationally beloved superstar."[412] After the release of the film, "Bohemian Rhapsody" re-entered the US Billboard Hot 100 for the third time (having previously charted in 1976 and 1992), charting at number 33 on 12 November 2018.[413]</p>
